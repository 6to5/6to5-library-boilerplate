# es6-library-boilerplate

Author libraries in ES6 for Node and the browser.

### Features

- Author in ES6
- Export ES5 / UMD
- Mocha/Chai/Sinon testing stack
- Unit tests that work in Node and the browser

### Gulp

There are three main Gulp tasks for you to use.

- `gulp` - Lint the library and tests, then run the unit tests
- `gulp build` - Lint then build the library
- `gulp test:browser` - Build the library for use with the browser spec runner.
  Changes to the source will cause the runner to automatically refresh.

### Browser Tests

The [browser spec runner](https://github.com/jmeas/es6-library-boilerplate/blob/master/test/runner.html)
can be opened in a browser to run your tests. For it to work, you must first run `gulp test:browser`. This
will set up a watch task that will automatically refresh the tests when your scripts, or the tests, change.

### FAQ

#### When should I consider using this boilerplate?

You're authoring a library that exports a single file, and that one file
exports a single variable.

#### When might I not want to use this boilerplate?

You can always use this boilerplate as inspiration, but it works best for smaller libraries.
If you're building a full-scale webapp, you will likely need many more changes to the build system.

### Customizing

This boilerplate is, to a certain extent, easily customizable. To make changes,
find what you're looking to do below and follow the instructions.

#### I want to change the primary source file

The primary source file for the library is `src/index.js`. Only the files that this
file imports will be included in the final build. To change the name of this entry file:

1. Rename the file
2. Update the value of `entryFileName` in `config/index.json`
3. Update the filename in `src/wrapper.js`

#### I want to change the exported file name

1. Update the value of `exportFileName` in `config/index.json`

#### I want to change what variable my module exports

`MyLibrary` is the name of the variable exported from this boilerplate. You can change this by following
these steps:

1. Ensure that the variable you're exporting exists in your scripts
2. Update the value of `exportVarName` in `config/index.json`

#### I want to change the destination directory

1. Update the value of `destinationFolder` in `config/index.json`
